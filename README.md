A small sound clip loading and playing API, with a file selection and active sound playing manager built on top.

When running, select a sound clip from the top table and press either 'Play Once' or 'Play Loop'.  This will add the clip onto active table.  'Play Once' clips will remove themselves from the active table, and can be paused/played, and looped clips can be manually removed with the 'Remove' button.
